    "[A data set](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts) is taken from a site, Hacker News which is a site started by the startup incubator [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/). The Hacker News is knows as where user-submitted stories (known as \"post\") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. It is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make is to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visotors as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, There are almost 300,000 rows. However, due to some submissions that do not receive any comments, it is reduced to approximately 20,000 rows. Throught the database, we classify the submissions into two types, which are Asking and Showing. We would want to know which type of the submission received more comments on average, as well as the time when the comments are received.\n",
