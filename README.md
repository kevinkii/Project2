# The Analysis on the Quantity Comments with Title between Asking and Showing
Our aim in this project is to find the styles of title in the Hacker News Community (HNC) that have a great quantity in comments. In the HNC, there are many posts are being posted in the purpose of attracting the fellow heckers to comment or answer their questions. In the community, it is important for us to know what types of submissions are popular. This means that, throughout this project, the finding will focus on the average of the comments for different types of submission and the time when the commented are posted.
